# Pronunciation

Vecinis is written more or less exactly the way it sounds. The presence of an aphostrophe, which indicates contraction, usually means irregular pronunciations. These irregulars have their pronunciation given with their introduction.

Here are what letters represent by themselves.

Letter|Pronunciation
---|---
a|/a/
â|/æ/
b|/b/
c|/æ/
d|/d/
d̄|/æ/
e|/æ/
g|/g/
i|/i/
j|/j/
k|/k/
l|/l/
m|/m/
n|/n/
o|/ɒ/
p|/p/
q|/q/
r|/ɹ/
r̂|/ɾ/
s|/s/
s̄|/ʃ/
t|/t/
t̄|/t͡ʃ/
u|/u/
û|/ʌ/
v|/v/
x|/x/
z|/z/
z̄|/ʒ/

Letters may also be combined.

Digraph|Pronunciation
---|---
rr|/l/
dr|/d͡ʒɹ/
tr|/t͡ʃɹ/
nj|/ɲ/

The following consonant combinations are allowed:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>pf</td><td>st</td><td>kj</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ts</td><td>dz</td><td>zm</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ks</td><td>gz</td><td>zn</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The following dipthongs are allowed:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>au</td><td>ou</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ia</td><td>ie</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Finally, some exceptions:
* \<r̂\> is pronounced /r/ before a consonant or at the beginning or end of a word.
* \<l\> is spelled \<rr\> in the middle of a word (but still pronounced /l/). The /l/ sound can *only* appear at the beginning of a word or surrounded by vowels.

The tick mark under certain letters does not affect pronunciation. Instead, it's to remind you this is a suffix, and not part of the root word. (Note not all suffixes have this tick mark.)

# Grammar

Vecinis sentence order is SVO, much like English. By default, nouns are handled ergatively, but are handled nominatively in certain kinds of phrases (which will be mentioned as they are brought up).

## Nouns

Nouns all have a mandatory suffix indicating their *animacy* and *ergativity*. These suffixes are pronounced slightly differently based on whether the root noun ends with a vowel, consonant, or the consonant of the suffix itself. Consult the table below.

Suffix|Purpose|After Vowel|After Consonant|After itself
|---|---|---|---|---
|-k̗|Animate Ergative|Vk̗ -> Vk|Ck̗ -> Cik|kk̗ -> k
|-s̗̄|Animate Absolutive|Vs̗̄ -> Vsh|Cs̗̄ -> Cish|s̄s̗̄ -> sh
|-q̗|Inanimate Ergative|Vq̗ -> Vg|Cq̗ -> Coq|qq̗ -> q
|-z̗|Inanimate Absolutive|Vz̗ -> Vz|Cz̗ -> Cuhz|zz̗ -> z

Most nouns are either animate or inanimate, although a few change meaning depending on whether they are treated animately or inanimately. Animacy also affects verb conjugations (see below). Therefore, the animacy of the subject of a sentence and the verb must agree. Animate nouns distinguish singular, paucal, and plural, while inanimate nouns make no such distictions.

Nouns _must_ have an article before them unless they are a proper noun or described by a possessive. 

Proper nouns are always Capitalized. Note in Vecinis, more things are considered proper nouns than in English, such as pronouns.

## Articles

Articles go before their noun. Keep in mind all nouns must have an article, a possesive, or be a proper noun.

In the following table, if there are two words in the Article box, the second is an abbreviation made when the affected noun starts with a vowel.

Article|Usage
---|---
dûn|Animate singular definite
d̄en|Animate plural definite
dux, d'|Inanimate any number definite
ri|Animate singular indefinite
rin|Animate plural indefinite
arro, arr'|Inanimate any number indefinite

In addition, the suffix en- also functions as an article on any noun. It's used to express "all" of something, or to emphasize the gnomic mood.

## Verbs

Verbs are fairly simple. Keeping a verb unconjugated in the infinitive implies the gnomic mood (ie, it's a given fact). To conjugate a verb, give it a suffix based on the animacy of the subject and tense as seen in the table below:

Tense|Animate|Inanimate
---|---|---
Past|-ti|-di
Present|-i|xi
Future|-kesi|-gez
Possible Future|-esi|-esi
Change in State*|-te|-de

*Change in State emphasizes something changed as a result of the verb. It usually refers to the past but may refer to other times.

## Adjectives

To have a noun described by an article, simply put the adjective before the article and the noun.

To copulize an adjective, add the suffix -v̗, which turns the adjective into a verb. This puts it in the simple present, implying gnomic mood. (There is a way to express more tense information, but it does not appear in the text.)

## Adverbs

Adverbs simply go before the thing (adjective, verb, or adverb) they describe, similar to adjectives.

Most information that would be handled with indirect objects, prepositions, conjunctions, or complex cases in other languages is handled with adverbs in Vecinis. Despite this, there are very few adverbs in Vecinis; instead, they are made out of other words.

The simplest way to construct an adverb is with the suffix -i̗ (always pronounced /i/). It turns any noun, verb, or adjective into an adverb. Because it requires many words to create noun or verb phrases in Vecinis (see below), this suffix is used quite a bit. For example, a Vecinis speaker would probably use -i̗ on "to like" to say she liked to do something instead of leaving "to like" as a verb.

Many other affixes turn words into adverbs in different ways. They are in the Vocabulary section.

Finally, adverbs in Vecinis can get quite long, especially when used with the pi ... go construction (see below). As a result, adverbs may also be placed before the sentence proper, seperated from the sentence with a comma. Other words placed before the sentence like this can be assumed to be adverbs with an implied -i̗.

## Varied Affixes

Vecinis has a number of affixes. The ones you have seen so far are used in specific cases, and there are others in the Vocabulary section.

Affixes can only be placed on words with a maximum of one other word affecting them. In order to affix onto more complex words, one must use pi ... go (literally "this ... thing"). This surrounds the words in question, with prefixes prefixing pi and suffixes suffixing go.

Pi ... go may also be used to group words together to aid understanding. It's often used with words such as iet̄ that require more complexity. This usage of pi ... go is not mandatory, and is often dropped when used in an adverb moved to the front of a sentence.

This pattern is almost universally abbreviated on pronouns. Each relavent contraction is marked in the Vocabulary section. An abbreviated Tu pattern still makes the possessed noun marked for absolutive.

## Verb Phrases

In order to say something like "I like to read books" or "I like reading books," one must use a verb phrase. A verb phrase converts an action (in this case, "read books") into a noun useable as a subject or object.

If the subject of the main sentence is the same as the subject of the verb phrase, use the prefix qe- on the verb. (This is the old pronunciation of "ke," which means "to do.") The object of that sentence, if any, is absolutive.

> Râk̗ zmoxi enarribz̗: I like books.
> Râk̗ jes̄en enarribz̗: I read books.
> Râk̗ zmoxi qejes̄en enarribz̗: I like to read books.

\* Note this example is a bit strange. A Vecinis speaker would usually turn "zmoxi" into an adverb and say "Râk̗ zmoxii̗ jes̄en enarribz̗" to save time.

(There is a way to express a verb phrase with a different subject, but it doesn't appear in the text.)

## Miscellaneous

A section for things that require explaining, but not so much they need a whole section.

### Tu
Tu is how possessives are expressed. The pattern is as such:

Tu A(ergative) B(absolutive) meaning "A's B."

Note no article is needed on A or B. If an article is truly required on A, (don't worry about it because it's not in the text.)

> Tu Râk̗ arrib: My book

### Iet̄
Iet̄ is used to place events in time.

Iet̄ goes after a sentence or phrase, turning it into an adverb meaning when it happened. It's almost always put before the sentence with a comma.

Iet̄ can get conjugated as if it were a verb (using the animacy of the subject as normal). This turns this "when" into a more specific placing in time. See the examples:

> Râs̗̄ kon iet̄i: While I eat (present tense)
> Râs̗̄ kon iet̄ti: Before I ate (past tense)
> Râs̗̄ kon iet̄kesi: After I ate (future)
> Râs̗̄ kon iet̄esi: After I might eat / When I eat (possible future)
> Râs̗̄ kon iet̄te: When I start / stop eating (change of state)

The verb can also be conjugated independently of iet̄:

> Râs̗̄ konte iet̄ti: Before I finish / start eating
> Râs̗̄ konkesi iet̄i: While I will eat / once I eat in the future

...and so on.
