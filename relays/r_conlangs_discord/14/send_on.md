# Pronunciation
Vecinis is written more or less exactly the way it sounds. The presence of an aphostrophe, which indicates contraction, usually means irregular pronunciations. These irregulars have their pronunciation given with their definition.

Here are what letters represent by themselves.

Letter|Pronunciation
---|---
a|/a/
â|/æ/
b|/b/
c|/s̪/
d|/d/
d̄|/d͡ʒ/
e|/ɛ/
g|/g/
i|/i/
j|/j/
k|/k/
l|/l/
m|/m/
n|/n/
o|/ɒ/
p|/p/
q|/q/
r|/ɹ/
r̂|/ɾ/
s|/s/
s̄|/ʃ/
t|/t/
t̄|/t͡ʃ/
u|/u/
û|/ʌ/
v|/v/
x|/x/
z|/z/
z̄|/ʒ/

Letters may also be combined.

Digraph|Pronunciation
---|---
rr|/l/
dr|/d͡ʒɹ/
tr|/t͡ʃɹ/
nj|/ɲ/

The following consonant combinations are allowed:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>pf</td><td>st</td><td>kj</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ts</td><td>dz</td><td>zm</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ks</td><td>gz</td><td>zn</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The following dipthongs are allowed:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>au</td><td>ou</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ia</td><td>ie</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Finally, some exceptions:
* \<r̂\> is pronounced /r/ before a consonant or at the beginning or end of a word.
* \<l\> is spelled \<rr\> in the middle of a word (but still pronounced /l/). The /l/ sound can *only* appear at the beginning of a word or surrounded by vowels.

The tick mark under certain letters does not always affect pronunciation. It's there to remind you that the letter is a suffix, and sometimes an additional vowel might be pronounced before it for ease of speaking.

# Grammar
Vecinis grammar is, on the whole, fairly simple.

## Sentence Order
By default, sentences are SVO and nouns are handled *ergatively*. However, if additional emphasis is wanted on the object, the sentence can be changed to SOV, in which case the nouns will be handled *nominatively*. This switching of sentence order may not happen if the verb has any adverbs on it.

## Nouns
Nouns all have a mandatory suffix indicating their *animacy* and their *ergativity* (or their *nominativity*). These suffixes are pronounced slightly differently based on whether the root noun ends with a vowel, consonant, or the consonant of the suffix itself. Consult the table below.

Suffix|Purpose|After Vowel|After Consonant|After itself
|---|---|---|---|---
|-k̗|Animate Ergative / Accusative|Vk̗ -> Vk|Ck̗ -> Cik|kk̗ -> k
|-s̗̄|Animate Absolutive / Nominative|Vs̗̄ -> Vsh|Cs̗̄ -> Cish|s̄s̗̄ -> sh
|-q̗|Inanimate Ergative / Accusative|Vq̗ -> Vg|Cq̗ -> Coq|qq̗ -> q
|-z̗|Inanimate Absolutive / Nominative|Vz̗ -> Vz|Cz̗ -> Cuhz|zz̗ -> z

Most nouns are either animate or inanimate, although a few change meaning depending on whether they are treated animately or inanimately. Animacy also affects verb conjugations (see below). Therefore, the animacy of the subject of a sentence and the verb must agree. Animate nouns distinguish singular, paucal, and plural, while inanimate nouns make no such distictions. In some cases, a ormally animate or inanimate noun may be treated as if it were the other animacy to emphasize that it has died or become animated.

Nouns _must_ have an article before them unless they are a proper noun or described by a possessive. 

Proper nouns are always Capitalized. Note in Vecinis, more things are considered proper nouns than in English, such as pronouns.

Examples:

> Râs̗̄ kâv: I run.
> Râk̗ ci dûn okjots̗̄: I see the man.
> Dûn okjotk̗ ci Râs̗̄: The man sees me.
> Râs̗̄ dûn okjotk̗ ci: I see *the man*.

## Verbs
Verbs are fairly simple. Keeping a verb unconjugated in the infinitive implies the gnomic mood (ie, it's a given fact). To conjugate a verb, give it a suffix based on the animacy of the subject and tense as seen in the table below:

Tense|Animate|Inanimate
---|---|---
Past|-ti|-di
Present|-i|xi
Future|-kesi|-gez
Possible Future|-esi|-esi
Change in State*|-te|-de

\* Change in State emphasizes something changed as a result of the verb. It usually refers to the past but may refer to other times.

## Adjectives

To have a noun described by an article, simply put the adjective before the article and the noun.

To copulize an adjective, add the suffix -v̗, which turns the adjective into a verb. This puts it in the simple present, implying gnomic mood. (There is a way to express more tense information, but it does not appear in the text.)

Examples:

> Sanû dûn okjot: The healthy man
> Dûn okjot sanûv̗: The man is healthy.

## Adverbs

Adverbs simply go before the thing (adjective, verb, or adverb) they describe, similar to adjectives.

Most information that would be handled with indirect objects, prepositions, conjunctions, or complex cases in other languages is handled with adverbs in Vecinis. Despite this, there are very few adverbs in Vecinis; instead, they are made out of other words.

The simplest way to construct an adverb is with the suffix -i̗ (always pronounced /i/). It turns any noun, verb, or adjective into an adverb. Because it requires many words to create noun or verb phrases in Vecinis (see below), this suffix is used quite a bit. For example, a Vecinis speaker would probably use -i̗ on "to like" to say she liked to do something instead of leaving "to like" as a verb.

Many other affixes turn words into adverbs in different ways. They are in the Vocabulary section.

Finally, adverbs in Vecinis can get quite long, especially when used with the pi ... go construction (see below). As a result, adverbs may also be placed before the sentence proper, seperated from the sentence with a comma. Other words placed before the sentence like this can be assumed to be adverbs with an implied -i̗.

## pi ... go
Vecinis has a number of affixes. The ones you have seen so far are used in specific cases, and there are others in the Vocabulary section.

Affixes can only be placed on words with a maximum of one other word affecting them. In order to affix onto more complex words, one must use pi ... go (literally "this ... thing"). This surrounds the words in question, with prefixes prefixing pi and suffixes suffixing go.

Pi ... go may also be used to group words together to aid understanding. It's often used with words such as iet̄ that require more complexity. This usage of pi ... go is not mandatory, and is often dropped when used in an adverb moved to the front of a sentence.

## Verb Phrases

In order to say something like "I like to read books" or "I like reading books," one must use a verb phrase. A verb phrase converts an action (in this case, "read books") into a noun useable as a subject or object.

If the subject of the main sentence is the same as the subject of the verb phrase, wrap the verb phrase in qe- av. ("qe-" is the old pronunciation of "ke: to do," and "av" means "to be.") Then, conjugate the "av" as if it were an animate noun, putting the relavent suffix on it.

If the verb phrase is the object of a sentence (as it usually is), the "av" may be dropped and the noun suffix put on the verb along with qe-.

Any nouns in the sentence are conjugated with the same ergativity / nominativity as the phrase itself.

> Râk̗ zmoxi enarribz̗: I like books.
> Râk̗ jes̄en enarribz̗: I read books.
> Râk̗ zmoxi qejes̄ens̗̄ enarribz̗: I like to read books. \*
> Qejes̄en enarribq̗ avs̗̄ njekov̗: Reading books is cool.

\* Note this example is a bit strange. A Vecinis speaker would usually turn "zmoxi" into an adverb and say "Râk̗ zmoxii̗ jes̄en enarribz̗" to save time.

## Tu
Tu has 3 main meanings.

Firstly, it is used for "you" when the subject is unfamiliar or formality is required. This usage is always capitalized.

Secondly, it is used for possesives. The pattern "Tu AAA(ergative) BBB(absolutive)" means AAA's BBB. This pattern does not change, regardless of its position in a sentence. This usage is capitalized only if the possesor is capitalized, and is often abbreviated when used with pronouns.

Finally, it is used to emphasize that an adjective affecting a noun is a qualifier or clarifier. It's often used when one would ask "What kind of X is this?" This usage is never capitalized (and also does not occur in this text.)
