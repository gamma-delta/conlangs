## In this chapter:
* A brief overview of Vecinis and the country of Vecinâ
* North and South Vecinis, the two main dialects
* A sample text

Ar̂o! This book is meant to be a complete guide to learning to speak, read, and understand both main dialects of Vecinis.

> This book is role-played. None of these people, languages, or countries actually exist. Notes in blockquotes like this are out-of-character information.

Vecinis is fairly similar to Strannic, in terms of vocabulary and grammar, so it's quite easy for Strannic speakers to learn. This has made it a sort of common tongue for the eastern countries, and many artificial and other scientific texts have been written in Vecinis.

> This book is written in Strannic, which is what they call English in-world. "Artificial" here means relating to artifice, the magic of the east.

Vecinis has two main dialects, North and South. Fortunately, they are quite similar, with the differences mostly in pronunciation. As the author lives in South Vecinâ, the book will mainly focus on the southern dialect, but the northern dialect will also be mentioned and taught.

## The Country of Vecinâ
Vecinâ is a largish country to the northeast of Strannum, known for its skilled artifice and industry. It used to be a loose collection of city-states before uniting under the flag of Latsobo tu Avecin in response to attack from Desi from the east, 153 years ago (as of the time of printing).

## A Sample of Written Vecinis
I always think a good way to get a sense of a language is to see some written out. To that end, here is a short story called The North Wind and the Sun written in Northern Vecinis, Southern Vecinis and Strannic.

> This is an actual story! My version here is based on this version: http://www.read.gov/aesop/143.html

#### Southern Vecinis
Makjabamiet̄, Dûn Eit tu Xixs̗̄ xiaz Dûn Mako tu Suknjos̗̄ qe ar̂etso vetsi̗ starkv̗ avbezki̗ râsteretsti. Etsos̗̄m maroki̗ steretsti iet̄i, pi Onik̗ tragi kjoks̗̄ ri gor̂abo jar̂ekiansti gor̂ai.

"Peqik j'avi xiasi qesh pi arhPeqik teiki znikenkesi qe Onik anrahthrag Th'Onik kjokish av go vetsi starkiv?" Mako tu Suknjok̗ kavi̗ du'asti.

> I'm not going to translate the rest of this right now, because I'm not confident enough in my Vecinis skills.

#### Strannic

Once upon a time, the North Wind and the Sun were arguing about which was stronger. While they were arguing heartily, a traveler wearing a cloak passed by them. 

"Do you agree that whoever can make the traveler take off his cloak is stronger?" said the Sun.

"Very well!" replied the North Wind, and started blowing freezing wind on the traveler. However, as the North Wind blew harder and harder, the traveler held his cloak tighter and tighter. Eventually, the North Wind gave up, huffing and puffing.

Next, it was the Sun's turn. He shone his gentle rays down on the traveler, and the traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang on his shoulders. As the Sun shone hotter and brighter, the traveler wiped his brow, took off his cloak, and sat down in the shade of a tree to escape the blazing heat.

*Kindness is truly better than force.*
