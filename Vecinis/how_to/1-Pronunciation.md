# 1: Pronunciation
Vecinis is spelled more or less the same way it is said, although there are a few exceptions. This makes it fairly easy to learn from a book.

## In this chapter:
* Sounds associated with certain letters
* Spelling rules and exceptions

There are two ways to write Vecinis. One is used for common, normal writing, and one is called "dialogue writing" and used for dialogue, phonetic transcription, or when Vecinis diacritics are not avaliable (for example, when using a Strannic printing press).

> Yes, this means you can type Vecinis with just a normal keyboard.

There are some pronunciation differences between North and South Vecinis. Fortunately, they are nearly completely consistent.

Below is a chart listing all the letters in the Vecinis alphabet, their pronunciation in North and South Vecinis using IPA, a Strannic approximation, and their dialogue writing.

> The IPA is the way linguists write out sounds unambiguously.

Two letters can be combined into **digraphs**, which makes some new sounds:

Digraph|Dialogue|North|Strannic (North)|South|Strannic (South)
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
rr|l|/l/|me**l**on|/l/|me**l**on
dr|dhr|/d͡ʒɹ/|**dr**op|/d͡ʒɹ/|**dr**op
tr|thr|/t͡ɬ/|(none)|/t͡ʃɹ/|**tr**ip
nj|nj|/ɲ/|(none)|/ɲ/|(none)

The following two-consonant combinations are allowed and simply pronounced together:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>pf</td><td>st</td><td>kj</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ts</td><td>dz</td><td>zm</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ks</td><td>gz</td><td>zn</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The following **dipthongs** or two-vowel combinations are allowed:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>au</td><td>ou</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>ia</td><td>ie</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Finally, some exceptions:
* 'r̂' is trilled and pronounced /r/ before a consonant or at the beginning or end of a word
* 'l' is spelled 'rr' in the middle of a word (but still pronounced /l/). The /l/ sound can *only* appear at the beginning of a word or surrounded by vowels.
